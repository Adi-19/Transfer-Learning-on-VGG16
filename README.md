# Transfer-Learning-on-VGG16

In deep learning, transfer learning is a technique whereby a pretrained neural network model is used on a problem that is being solved previously. 

# Pre-Training
When we train the network on a large dataset(for example: ImageNet) , we train all the parameters of the neural network and therefore the model is learned. It may take hours on your GPU.
